description: Use at the start of a pricing project to route work across other skills (quant-pricing, architecture, implementation, qa, notebook).
---
Workflow:
1) Ask for missing essentials (instrument, payoff, market inputs, required method, deliverables).
2) Produce a 5-step execution plan and explicitly name which skills to invoke per step.
3) Start with architecture + quant assumptions before coding.
4) Enforce: tests + notebook are mandatory deliverables.
